# FlashKill
Flash is a project that I am working on now,
It's programmed in Python but i will probably rewrite it to C#, C, C++ or some other language,
to make it faster :)

# What's Flashkill?
###### Don't ask about the dramatic name... :D
Flashkill is a closed-source program designed to enhance security by detecting when a USB drive is removed from your PC. Upon detection, it can automatically shut down or restart your system, encrypt files to protect sensitive data, or execute custom actions tailored to your needs, including potential disk formatting.

# Demo
The program offers a demo version that allows users to test the USB removal detection feature up to 14 times per week. This limit resets every week, enabling users to assess the program's effectiveness without restrictions on overall usage. While some advanced functions require a license for full access, the demo provides a practical way to experience the core functionalities.

# I need help
I need help with this project, I think i can't make it ALL myself.
I can try but I don't think I cloud succeed. If I don't I will
probably open-source it!
